# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are the pipeline that allows React to pass information from the parent component to the child component. Props can only move information from the parent to the child. 

  Researched answer: Props, short for properties, allows for the passage of information from parent to child components in React. Props only pass information in one direction and only accepts one argument that can include data and behavior.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is a change in the code that is triggered by user interaction with the user interface. An example of a DOM event could be an onClick or hovering over an input field. A DOM event tells the code to perform a specific output based off of this user interaction. 

  Researched answer: A Document Object Model, or DOM, event is a signal to the code that a change has been made by the user or the browser. Examples of DOM events include an onClick, web page loading, mouse moving over an element, or other interaction with the coding language.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming, or OOP, is a scripting language methodology that bases its syntax off things that exist in reality, like objects. It is considered to be a more visual language that tends to draw developers who prefer visual learning. Functional programming is based on mathematical principles. Both types of programming have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the project and developer's strengths and weaknesses. 

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming methodology that uses objects to represent data, often real-world objects. OOP uses objects to hold attributes about the objects. Methods and functions are used to manipulate and access the objects. Functional programming is based on creating functions. Both types of programming have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the project and developer's strengths and weaknesses. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: Integer is the data type name used for whole numbers in Ruby. Float gives the remainder of integers. A float has to be introduced to the code evaluation in Ruby in order to return a float. 

  Researched answer: Integers are the data type name for whole numbers in Ruby and can be used to perform mathematical operations. Float is the data type used for partial numbers. If a developer wants a partial number a float needs to be introduced to the equation to return a float output.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Developers do not need to write 'return' in a method in Ruby. The return is implied so the code will give an output without a written 'return' statement. 

  Researched answer: Implicit return in Ruby is the automatic return of the last line of a method. Ruby will always return the last line of a method, unless it is told otherwise. Developers can add a 'return', but it is unnecessary for the language to run the method. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: A type of variable that begins with an @ symbol. Instance variables can be assigned an initial value and altered as necessary later in a method for a particular use case. 

2. PostgreSQL: Is a database management system that allows developers to compile information into a database and users to make queries to extract information from the database. 

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is an open source software that allows developers to build web applications with the Ruby programming language. 

4. ORM: Object-relational mapping, or ORM, is a way to convert data types that otherwise would not be able to evaluate against or with one another. ORM is used for object-oriented programming languages.

5. Active Record: Active record is the layer between a Rails applicaiton and its database. Active record is used to send a query to a database and allows user to interact with the data.
